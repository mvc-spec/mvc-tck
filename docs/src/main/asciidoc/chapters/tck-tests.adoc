== Running the TCK tests

This chapter describes how to run and configure the TCK test suite against a given MVC 1.0 implementation in a given Java EE container.
The testsuite uses http://arquillian.org/[Arquillian] to execute tests against real Java EE containers.
It is strongly recommended making yourself familiar with the Arquillian documentation.
It will give you a deeper understanding of the different parts described in the following sections.

=== The TCK runner template

The TCK contains a directory `sample` which contains an example project for running the TCK and
which should be used as a template for creating new projects.
This sample project is using the reference implementation Eclipse Krazo and runs the TCK against Eclipse Glassfish 5.1.0.

The project is using Apache Maven is contains just three files:

`pom.xml`::
  The Maven POM file imports the TCK BOM, declares all required dependencies and configure the Maven Surefire Plugin
  to run the tests defined by the MVC 1.0 TCK.

`arquillian.xml`::
  This file configures Arquillian to deploy the web applications which are used by the TCK tests to Eclipse Glassfish.

`KrazoGlassfishProvider.java`::
  This Java class is an implementation of the `BaseArchiveProvider` interface which is part of the TCK.
  The responsibility of the archive provider is to create a base Shrinkwrap archive which is used by all TCK
  tests. The archive produced by the provider depends on the specific environment you are running the tests
  against. As MVC 1.0 API and implementation is not provided by Eclipse Glassfish, the `KrazoGlassfishProvider`
  builds and archive which adds the API JAR and Eclipse Krazo to the `/WEB-INF/lib` directory of the archive so
  that both are deployed as part of the web application.

Running the TCK is simple. First you have to download, unpack and start Eclipse Glassfish 5.1.0.
Then just execute the following command in the sample project folder to run the TCK against this Eclipse Glassfish instance:

[source,sh]
----
mvn verify
----

After a few minutes you should get an output like this:

----
[...]

Congratulations! You just ran the MVC 1.0 TCK!

=== Adjusting the template project

If you want to run the MVC 1.0 TCK against a different environment,
you should start from the template project and adjust it like described in the following sections.

=== Update Arquillian configuration

If you want to run the TCK against a different container, you will typically have to adjust the Arquillian configuration.
In most cases this is really easy, because Arquillian already supports a wide range of containers.
However, it is strongly recommended having a deeper look at the
http://arquillian.org/docs/[Arquillian documentation] to learn more.

Generally, you will have to follow these steps:

* Replace the `arquillian-glassfish-remote-3.1` Arquillian adapter with the adapter for your environment
  in the `pom.xml` file.
* Then adjust the `arquillian.xml` file as described in the Arquillian adapter documentation.
  This typically includes adjusting port numbers and providing credentials for performing remote deployments.

As mentioned above, the details depend on the specific environment.

=== Provide a custom BaseArchiveProvider

The `BaseArchiveProvider` is used by the TCK to create a base web application archive capable of running MVC 1.0
application in the specific target environment. The TCK then just adds controllers, views and other
artifacts to that base archive and deploys it to the target container.

As the template project runs the TCK against Eclipse Glassfish 5.1.0 which doesn't provide support for MVC 1.0
out of the box, the corresponding archive provider creates a web application archive which includes both
the MVC 1.0 API JAR and the reference implementation Eclipse Krazo in `/WEB-INF/lib`.

The default implementation provided with the template project looks like this:

[source,java,subs="attributes"]
----
public class KrazoGlassfishProvider implements BaseArchiveProvider {

    @Override
    public WebArchive getBaseArchive() {

        File[] dependencies = Maven.resolver()
                .resolve(
                        "javax.mvc:javax.mvc-api:{mvc-api-version}",
                        "org.eclipse.krazo:krazo-core:{krazo-version}",
                        "org.eclipse.krazo:krazo-jersey:{krazo-version}"
                )
                .withoutTransitivity()
                .asFile();

        return ShrinkWrap.create(WebArchive.class)
                .addAsLibraries(dependencies);

    }

}
----

You will have to create a similar class which does the same for the environment you want to run the test against.

If your container provides MVC 1.0 support out of the box, you would have to create an implementation which returns
an empty archive like this:

[source,java]
----
public class EmptyArchiveProvider implements BaseArchiveProvider {

    @Override
    public WebArchive getBaseArchive() {
        return ShrinkWrap.create(WebArchive.class);
    }

}
----

The TCK uses a Java system property to learn about the implementation that should be used for building archives.
This system property is configured using the Maven Surefire Plugin configuration in your `pom.xml`.
The relevant section in the template project looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<plugin>
    <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.19.1</version>
    <configuration>
        <dependenciesToScan>org.mvc-spec.tck:mvc-tck-tests</dependenciesToScan>
        <systemProperties>
            <org.mvcspec.tck.api.BaseArchiveProvider>
                org.mvcspec.tck.runner.KrazoGlassfishProvider
            </org.mvcspec.tck.api.BaseArchiveProvider>
        </systemProperties>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
----

If you provide a custom implementation of `ArchiveBaseProvider`, you will have to adjust the configuration
and change the FQCN if the implementation class.
