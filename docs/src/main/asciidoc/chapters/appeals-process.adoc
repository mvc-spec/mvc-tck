== Appeals Process

The MVC 1.0 has been created with maximum care. However, it's reasonable to assume that an implementor may
discover new and/or better ways to validate the assertions. This chapter covers the appeals process,
defined by the MVC 1.0 Specification Leads, which allows implementors of the MVC 1.0 specification to
challenge one or more tests defined by the MVC 1.0 TCK.

The appeals process identifies who can make challenges to the TCK, what challenges to the TCK may be submitted,
how these challenges are submitted, how and by whom challenges are addressed
and how accepted challenges to the TCK are managed.

=== Who can make challenges to the TCK?

Everybody may submit an appeal to challenge one or more tests in the MVC 1.0 TCK.
In fact, the Specification Leads and members of the MVC 1.0 Expert Group encourage this level of participation.

=== What challenges to the TCK may be submitted?

Any test case (i.e. `@Test` method), test case configuration (i.e. `@Deployment`), test entities,
annotations and other resources may be challenged by an appeal.

What is generally not challengeable are the assertions made by the specification. The specification document
is controlled by a separate process and challenges to it should be handled through the MVC 1.0 Expert Group.

=== How these challenges are submitted?

To submit a challenge, a new issue should be created in the https://github.com/mvc-spec/mvc-tck[mvc-tck] GitHub repository.
The appellant should select the *TCK Challenge* template and answer the following questions:

* The relevant specification version and section number(s)
* The coordinates of the challenged test(s)
* The exact TCK and exclude list versions
* The implementation being tested, including name and company
* The full test name
* A full description of why the test is invalid and what the correct behavior is believed to be
* Any supporting material; debug logs, test output, test logs, run scripts, etc.

To submit an issue in the GitHub repository, you must have a (free) GitHub account.
You can create a GitHub account using the https://github.com/join[on-line registration].

=== How and by whom challenges are addressed?

The challenges will be addressed in a timely fashion by the MVC 1.0 TCK Project Lead,
as designated by Specification Lead, or his/her designate.
The appellant can also monitor the process by watching the issue filed.

=== How accepted challenges to the TCK are managed?

Accepted challenges will be acknowledged via the filed issue's comment section.
Communication between the MVC 1.0 TCK Project Lead and the appellant will take place via the issue comments.
The issue's status will be set to "Closed" when the TCK project lead believes the issue to be resolved.
The appellant should, within 30 days, comment on the issue if they do not believe the issue to be resolved.
